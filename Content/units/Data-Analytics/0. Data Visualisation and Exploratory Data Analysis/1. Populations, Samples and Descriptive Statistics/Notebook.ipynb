Subsequent to breaking these down into a further taxonomy of *ordinal*, *nominal*, *interval*, and *ratio*, we will discuss **descriptive statistics**, specifically focusing on *measures of central tendency* and *measures of dispersion*.\n"

        "Firstly, it's important to realise that in the large majority of cases when we're working with data, we do not have access to all the members of the **population**.\n",
        "> The population is the set which contains the *entire members* of a specified group.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "- Hours of sleep for **all** undergraduate students\n",
        "- Education level of **all** customers at US grocery stores\n",
        "- Time spent participating in group sports by **all** boys ages 15-19\n",
        "\n",
        "You have probably realised that collecting data on all members of the population is in a lot of cases not feasible. Such a task would be expensive in terms of both time and cost. However we often want to make judgements or come to conclusions about entire populations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The solution to this is **sample** data. Typically whenever we see statistics being reported to us regarding an entire population, it is highly likely that these statistics have been calculated on a sample of the population. A small, but **well chosen** sample is able able to accurately provide us with information representative of a whole population.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Well chosen\" is important. Imagine we wanted to make assumptions regarding the education level of customers at US grocery stores. If we picked our samples almost exclusively from Silicon Valley (I am assuming the average person in Silicon Valley has a higher education level than other cities in the US), our results and analysis would be skewed because we would be making assumptions about the entire US customer population based on results from one area.\n",
        "\n",

When it comes round to you having to build your own samples/datasets keep the following guidelines in mind.

        "\n",
        "*Continuous data* refers to numerical data that can take any value within a range and can be subdivided into finer and finer levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, if we measure the height of individuals, we could find values like 1.75 meters, 1.752 meters, or even more precise intervals. This type of data is infinite and non-countable because between any two values, we can always find another value. Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation can be calculated from continuous data, and it can be visualized using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, among others. We will learn more about plotting different types of data in a later lesson.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Categorical Data\n",
        "\n",
        "*Categorical data* refers to data that has a finite number of possible categories we can observe.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we are collecting data on someone's country of births, we know that there are only around 195 possibilities. Likewise, if we are collecting data on the number of bedrooms in a sample of properties, we could also consider this to be a categorical variable. Although there is no clear theoretical maximum number of bedrooms, we know that the number is finite, and will only take an integer value. In this case we would infer the number of categories directly from our sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Nominal Data\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of country of birth being collected as data, there is no inherent ordering. This type of data is known as *nominal data*, and is the classification of data such as name, gender, and ethnicity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Ordinal Data\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, we know that a 3-bedroom property is likely to be larger and more expensive than a 2-bedroom property, all other things being equal. If we treat number of bedrooms as a categorical variable, then we know that the categories have an inherent order, which should be considered during analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "When dealing with categorical data, we can calculate how many times a category occurs, known as the *frequency*. We can also determine the *relative frequency* by dividing the frequency of a category by the total number of observations. Using frequencies, we can calculate the mode of the data set.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given that nominal data is not numerical and has no inherent order, we cannot compute any other statistics on it. With ordinal data, on the other hand, given the inherent ordering, we can also calculate the median and consequently, the interquartile range.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will view how to visualize these data types in a later section. We will now compute the descriptive statistics of the `furniture` column, which is nominal, and the `rooms` column, which is ordinal."
